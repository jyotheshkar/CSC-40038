Classification Models:
Uses three methods to train and test the data, to give overall accuracy scores for future predictions.

Data Analysis:
The data analysis folder runs the analysis on the raw data to give an insight on the data set.

Data Imputation:
The data imputation folder tests the accuracy of the models, and then uses to impute data.

Prediction model and GUI:
the folder contains the code for  OLS regression, Elastic Net regression and Decison Trees that were used to try and predict the number of registrations of an event.

Regression models:
the folder contains the code for  ARIMA, SARIMAX regression and exponetial Smoothing used to forecast the number of bookings.

Time series models:
Logistic regression used to predict how many people would be present at an event based on Elastic Net regression that was used for the forecasting. A GUI was used to present these results.
