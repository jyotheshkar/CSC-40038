Booking Activity Analysis

This Python script analyzes booking data, providing insights into weekly booking activity through a visual representation. It processes booking data from a CSV file, calculates weekly booking counts, their z-scores, and visualizes the data using a bar chart. Each bar represents the number of bookings for a given week, with annotations for the booking count and its z-score. The script also highlights weeks with booking counts above a certain threshold.

Calculating weekly booking counts, including weeks with zero bookings.
Computing z-scores for booking counts to identify outliers.
Visualizing weekly booking activity with a bar chart.
Annotating bars with booking counts and z-scores.
Highlighting weeks with booking counts above the mean plus one standard deviation.
